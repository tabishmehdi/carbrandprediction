# carbrandprediction
Its a car brand prediction kaggle problem. There are three different classes of car like Audi, Lamborgini and Mercedes.
I have used a GUI in which I upload one of the car brand image and model would predict which class this image belongs to.
I have used transfer learning like Resnet 50 to predict the image.
